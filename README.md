| scope        | `String`                   | A space-delimited list of scopes that identify the resources that your application could access on the user's behalf. These values define the consent screen that Klarna displays to the user.                                                                                                                                    |

| loginHint    | `named optional` `String?` | If your application knows which user is trying to authenticate, it can use this parameter to provide a hint to the Klarna’s Authorization Server. The server uses the hint to simplify the login flow by prefilling the email field in the sign-in form. It’s recommended to use this as it will improve the customer experience. | 
| responseType | `named optional` `String?` | The desired grant type. The value MUST be one of "code" for requesting an authorization code or "token" for requesting an access token (implicit grant). The default is "code"                                                                                                                                                    |

* **Tell how recently you started having the issue.** When was the first time you experienced the issue and was it after updating the SDK version? Or has it always been a problem?
* If the problem started happening recently, **can you reproduce it in an older version of the SDK?** What's the most recent version in which the problem doesn't happen?
* **Can you reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, explain how often it occurs and under what conditions it usually happens. For example, in what environment you are running.

Include details about the device/emulator/simulator you are experiencing the issue on:

* **Which version of the SDK are you using?**
* **Which OS is this a problem in, iOS, Android or both?** What version(s)? Also, add the appropriate label to the issue.
* **Did you experience the issue in simulator/emulator or on real device(s)?**
